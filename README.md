UW 510 Final Project - Airline Reservation System

Airline Reservation System
The goal of this project is to create an airline reservation system where customers can:
•	View flights for a specified date range
    The following information will be displayed – origin city, destination city, start time, end time, cost of fare, full or available
•	View/make/modify/cancel reservations
    Customers can either view their reservations, make a new one, modify existing or cancel their reservations
•	View seat map and select seats
    Display seat map in the form of a matrix with X showing reserved seats and       showing available seats
    Customers can then choose whichever seat is free
•	Make payment using card
    Customer can provide credit card details to make a reservation
Time permitting, I would also like to implement a waitlist (using circular queue data structure) if the flight is full.
